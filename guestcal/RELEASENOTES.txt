Description:
Security fix

It is enough to replace the file "includes/db.class.php".


### GuestCal 2.1.1 (17.04.2009) ###

Description:
Security fix

On http://secunia.com/advisories/34721/ there is a security issue reported. The GET parameter "lang" was not sufficiently validated before including the language file. This issue is not very critical, since an attacker could only load files within a folder "lang" and ending with "inc.php". Nevertheless, uprading to 2.1.1 is highly recommended. It is enough to replace the file "includes/ini.inc.php".

Additionally, GuestCal is now W3C conform.
